# 💳 My Card
This is my first Flutter project — a simple screen with a clean design that displays information about me.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a basic Flutter app with a simple user interface.  
- Display personal information in a clean, visually appealing way. 

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter.  
- **Editor:** VS Code (or your preferred IDE).  
- **Design:** Simple and minimal UI.

## 📱 Key Features
- A single screen showing personal info (name, contact, etc.).  
- Clean and straightforward design using Flutter widgets.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.  
2. Open the project in **VS Code** (or your preferred editor).  
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.  
4. Run the app on your preferred platform:  
 - **Web browser:**  
     ```command line
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```  
     *(You can replace `chrome` with your preferred browser, e.g., `edge`, `firefox`, or `safari`.)*

 - **Android or iOS emulator/device:**  
    *(Make sure your emulator is running or your real device is connected and authorized)*  
    ```command line
    flutter run
    ```

## 📝 Notes
 - The app may not look perfect in the browser because it was primarily designed and optimized for mobile devices.
